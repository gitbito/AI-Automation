Having gone through the initial phase of generating unit test cases, let's take a step further to ensure that all paths in our code are thoroughly tested. This includes both the happy paths, and more importantly, the error paths.

1. Completion of Happy Path Tests (Only if needed):
   - Please review the previously generated test cases. If there are any incomplete tests or areas not fully covered, let's complete those. This includes any comments like "//write the rest of the test cases here" or "//write test cases for the rest of the endpoints here".

2. Generation of Error Path Tests:
   - Now, let's focus on the potential points of failure in the code. This includes scenarios with invalid input data, unexpected user behavior, failure of external dependencies and different responses.
   - Please generate test cases that simulate these error conditions. Ensure that the system handles them correctly and provides the right error messages, status codes, and side effects.

Remember, the goal here is to ensure the robustness of our code by testing all possible paths.
Please output the entire test on a single code block, with the happy and error paths, I want to copy it directly from this last response so print the entire test file.

Also, I want to add this watermark as initial comment on the file: "This test file was generated by Bito, see more on https://github.com/gitbito/AI-Automation"
